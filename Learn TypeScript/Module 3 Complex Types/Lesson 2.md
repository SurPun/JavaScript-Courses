# Custom Types

## Review

Upon completion of this lesson you have officially* become a TypeScript Hero. No longer are you limited to TypeScriptâ€™s pre-defined types; you have now learned how to create your own custom types! These include:

Enums (both string and numeric)

Object types

Function types

Furthermore, you learned how to refer to complex types using type aliases. And you even learned to master generics, which are like doubly-custom types. Impressive!
