# Creating an Expo App

Now that we know a bit about how Expo and React Native works, let’s dive into it and create our first mobile app!

## Requirements

In order to create the app, you’ll first need a few things installed on your computer:

Node.js - A JavaScript runtime

Visual Studio Code - A text editor

Terminal Commands

```
Throughout the video, you’ll need to enter several commands into the terminal:
node -v - Checks your version of Node.js
npm -v - Checks your version of Node package manager
npm install -g expo-cli - Installs the Expo command-line tools
Expo command-line tools make it really easy to create, maintain, and test an Expo project!
expo init hello-world - Creates a new Expo app
cd hello-world - Moves you into the hello-world folder
```
