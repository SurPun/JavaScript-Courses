# Intro to React Native

## Review

Well done! In this lesson, we covered some basic concepts from Expo and React Native:

React Native is a library that uses React for mobile app development to create performant apps with JavaScript.

Expo is a platform for universal React apps that contains React Native and helps you iterate fast, without any native platform knowledge.

Components in React Native have a native component counterpart that is rendered on the native platform.

Expo and React Native runs your React JavaScript in the actual app, in a different thread from the UI to keep your app running smoothly.

Just like React, Expo and React Native uses the entry point of your app to render it on different native platforms.

Because different native platforms arenâ€™t identical, some components behave differently on some platforms.
