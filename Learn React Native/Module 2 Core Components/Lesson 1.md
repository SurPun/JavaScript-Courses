# Core Components

## Reviews

Well done! You’ve covered some of React Native’s most common core components. Let’s review:

The View component can be used to create responsive layouts using flexbox, or add basic styling to nested components.

The Text component displays text. On Android and iOS, all text strings needs to be wrapped in one of these.

The Image component displays images. They can be referenced using an https:// link, local file:// reference, Base64-encoded string, or image imported as module with require.

The ScrollView component is a “visible” container with the scrolling functionality added. In most places, you wouldn’t need scrolling.

The Button component is used for “click” or “press” interactions.

The TextInput component is used for capturing user input.

Components can be combined into custom components for consistent style and reusability.
