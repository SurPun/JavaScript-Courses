# Learn Phaser: Basics

## Review

With all of the tools we just learned, we have everything we need to make a huge number of games. Think about games that you’ve played and try to imagine how they break down into the following steps:

Loading in assets (all the sounds and images for your game: 3D models and textures would also be assets here although that isn’t something we’re going to be handling in Phaser).
Setting up a scene by creating all of the interactive game objects.
Adding event listeners and handlers to those game objects.
Updating the scene each frame, detecting if buttons are pressed and triggering events based on those button presses.
Here’s a quick review of the concepts we’ve covered in [cheat sheet form.](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-phaser/Phaser%20Quick%20Guide.pdf?_gl=1*lckf1v*_ga*NzM0MzYxNzI2NC4xNjc1MDg5OTAw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3ODAzMDIyOC4yNC4xLjE2NzgwMzI2ODguMC4wLjA.)

These are all core game development strategies at the heart of nearly every game you’ll play, and you’ve conquered them in Phaser! Congratulations!
