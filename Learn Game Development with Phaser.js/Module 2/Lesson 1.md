# Learn Phaser: Physics

## Review

Great job using Phaserâ€™s Arcade physics plugin to make an entire game!

In this exercise we covered:

    Creating sprites that are affected by physics.

    Creating groups of sprites affected by physics.

    Creating groups of sprites NOT affected by physics.

    Adding Colliders objects between sprites and groups of sprites.

    Creating a loop to continuously execute a function.

    Pausing physics.

    Restarting a Scene.

    See what else you can do!
