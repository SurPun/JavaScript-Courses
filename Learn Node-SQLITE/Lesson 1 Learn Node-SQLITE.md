# Learn Node-SQLITE

## Wrap Up

Wow, we were able to take data from a source, manipulate it for our needs, and save it separately. We’ve managed to set up a database, create tables, insert data, and modify it — all within JavaScript! We learned about how to ensure that JavaScript runs a set of commands chronologically so that we can avoid race conditions. We leveraged JavaScript methods fluently alongside our database queries in SQL. Now our knowledge of SQL and our understanding of JavaScript can work together to accomplish more than either could alone.

Good job!
