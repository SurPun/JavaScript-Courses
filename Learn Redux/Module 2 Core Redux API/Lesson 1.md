# Intro to the Core Redux API

## Review

Congratulations! You were able to apply the core concepts of the Redux framework by implementing an application using the Redux library.

By completing this lesson, you are now able to:

Install the redux library into your project using npm install redux.

Import the createStore() helper function from the 'redux' library.

Create a store object that holds the entire state of your Redux application using createStore().

Get the current state of the store using store.getState().

Dispatch actions to the store using store.dispatch(action).

Create action creators to reduce the repetitive creation of action objects.

Register a change listener function to respond to changes to the store using store.subscribe(listener).

Recognize the pattern for connecting Redux to any user interface.

Implement a Redux application using either the HTML DOM API or React.

Throughout this lesson, you may have thought to yourself that Redux adds a lot of unnecessary complexity to these simple applications. We implemented Redux in a very basic way, which is useful for learning but not how itâ€™s done in the real world.

Redux shines when it is used in applications with many features and a lot of data where having a centralized store to keep it all organized is advantageous. In the next lesson, you will learn how to build and organize Redux applications with complex state.
