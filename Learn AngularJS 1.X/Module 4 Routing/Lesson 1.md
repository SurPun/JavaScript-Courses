# Routing

## Generalizations

Why are routes useful? Instead of filling a single view with more code than needed, routes let us map URLs to self-contained controllers and templates. Furthermore, now that the app has URLs, users can easily bookmark and share the appâ€™s pages.

What can we generalize so far?

Directives are a way to make standalone UI components, like <app-info>

Services are a way to make standalone communication logic, like forecast which fetches weather data from a server

Routes are a way to manage apps containing more views.
