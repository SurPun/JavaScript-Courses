# Your First App

## Generalizations

Congratulations! You built an AngularJS app from scratch. What can we generalize so far?

A user visits the AngularJS app.

The view presents the app’s data through the use of expressions, filters, and directives. Directives bind new behavior to HTML elements.

A user clicks an element in the view. If the element has a directive, AngularJS runs the function.

The function in the controller updates the state of the data.

The view automatically changes and displays the updated data. The page doesn’t need to reload at any point.
