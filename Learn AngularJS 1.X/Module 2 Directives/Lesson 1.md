# Directives

## Generalizations

Well done! An “Install” button now shows up under each app. When you click the button, it changes to an “Uninstall” button. When you click it again, it changes back to an “Install” button.

What can we generalize so far?

Directives are a powerful way to create self-contained, interactive components. Unlike jQuery which adds interactivity as a layer on top of HTML, AngularJS treats interactivity as a native component of HTML.
