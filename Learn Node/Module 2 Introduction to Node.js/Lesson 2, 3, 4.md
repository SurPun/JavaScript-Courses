In this article, you have learned the following:

The benefits of implementing modular programs.

How to use the Node.js module.exports object to export code from a file - meaning its functions and/or data can be used by other files/modules.

How to use the Node.js require() function to import the functions and/or data from another module.

How to use object destructuring to only import the desired components of a module.

Congratulations on reaching this milestone! With a little more practice, you will soon be able to handle Node.js modules with ease.
