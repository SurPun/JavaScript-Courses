# Introduction to Node.js

## Review

Awesome work! You’ve learned a lot about some fundamental Node.js concepts and modules. Let’s take a moment to review what we learned:

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, an environment that allows us to execute our JavaScript code by converting it into something a computer can understand.

REPLs are processes that read, evaluate, print, and repeat (loop), and Node.js comes with its own REPL we can access in our terminal with the node command.

We run JavaScript programs with Node in the terminal by typing node followed by the file name (if we’re in the same directory) or the absolute path of the file.

Code can be organized into separate files, modules, and combined through requiring them where needed using the require() function.

Core modules are built into the Node.js environment to efficiently perform common tasks.

The console module exports a global console object allowing the terminal to act as a debugging console, similar to the JavaScript console object provided by web browsers.

The process module is a global module that gives access to information about the Node.js runtime environment.

The os module provides methods to retrieve information about the computer, operating system, and network interfaces.

The util module contains methods used to maintain and debug your code.

You learned some of the key core modules built into Node.js, but as you know, there are many more. You can even create your own modules, as well as use third-party modules built by other developers.

But don’t worry! A good thing to remember when learning Node is that it’s not necessary to memorize every module, method, or other specific aspects of the environment. The best way to get comfortable with Node is to practice making things with it. Your imagination is the limit! So keep going to learn how [to download Node on your local machine.](https://www.codecademy.com/article/setting-up-node-locally)

Great work! We’re excited to see what you build!
